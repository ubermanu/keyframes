# CSS Keyframes Editor

This is a port of the original Chrome extension from [Michael Bolliger](https://michaelbolliger.com/). <br>
This project is purely for practice with React and Chrome extensions.

If you need a boilerplate for an injected React App as Chrome extension you can check my other project: https://github.com/ubermanu/react-chrome-extension

### Development

    yarn start

Starts a webpack dev server to preview the injected app.

### Build

    yarn build

The extension is not actually packaged, but you can still use the dist folder.

### Keyframes.app

You can view the new repo for Keyframes.app at [github.com/mitchas/Keyframes](https://github.com/mitchas/Keyframes). <br>
